# Web Tools - Online Toolkit

Web Tools is a pure front-end online toolkit designed to provide convenient and practical tools to help with daily tasks.

## Tools Features

Currently, Web Tools offers the following useful tools:

1. **Markdown Image Extractor** - Extract all base64 encoded images from Markdown files and package them for download
2. **Image Format Converter** - Convert images between PNG and JPG formats
3. **PNG Cleaner** - Remove unnecessary data chunks from PNG files to reduce file size

## Pure Front-end Processing

All tools run completely in the browser and do not upload your files to any server. This means:

- **High Privacy** - Your files always remain on your local device and are not uploaded anywhere
- **Offline Availability** - After loading the page, you can continue using the tools offline
- **Processing Speed Depends on Your Device** - Conversion and processing operations use your device's CPU and memory resources

## Processing Performance Notes

Since all processing is done in the browser, the performance of the tools will be affected by the following factors:

- Your device's CPU performance
- Available memory
- Browser processing capabilities
- File size and quantity

For large files or batch processing of multiple files, longer processing times may be required, depending on your device's performance.

## Usage Tips

- **Image Format Converter**: When converting PNG to JPG, transparency will be lost; you can set a background color
- **PNG Cleaner**: Basic mode is suitable for most users, while advanced mode allows for finer control
- **Markdown Image Extractor**: Supports base64 encoded images in standard Markdown syntax
- **Test**: Can be tested locally with commands: `live-server --mount=/web-tools-box:. --port=xxxx`

## Compatibility

Web Tools supports all modern browsers, including:

- Google Chrome 90+
- Mozilla Firefox 90+
- Microsoft Edge 90+
- Safari 14+

Internet Explorer is not supported.

## Language and Theme

Web Tools provides Chinese and English interfaces, which you can switch between using the language toggle button at the top.

Additionally, the application supports light and dark themes, which can automatically switch based on system settings or be manually selected according to your preference.

## Privacy Statement

Web Tools respects your privacy:

- Does not collect any user data
- Does not track user behavior
- Does not use third-party analytics tools
- All processing is done locally
